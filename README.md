To generate the list of secreted proteases, PFAM domains related to proteases according to MEROPS were used (MEROPS - the Peptidase Database).

The catalytic type corresponding to each PFAM domain can therefore be traced back.

A column indicating the catalytic type (Aspartic (A), Cysteine (C), Glutamic (G), Metallo (M), Asparagine (N), Mixed (P), Serine (S), Threonine (T), Unknown (U)) to which the protease corresponds is added as metadata.

PFAM.xlsx (contains PFAM-related family and subfamily information

Retrive the Family and subfamily info from PFAM.xlsx for the corresponding Gene_ID in Guy_11_Compiled.xlsx. The Protein_accession_final.xlsx can be used to connect the PFAM.xlsx and Guy_11_Compiled.xlsx.
